## Usage
Once the list of Java conferences is loaded, the app will show you all conferences in the month they will happen.
Behind the name of the month you will also see the number of conferences in that specific month.
When selecting 'All', the app will open the current month per default.
You can choose whether you attend, not attend or speak at a conference.
Selecting 'Speaking' will only show you the conference you will speak at and when selecting 'CfP open' it will
only show you the conferences where the CfP is still open.

## Conference Info
Each conference comes with the following information:
- Name of the conference
- City and Country where it will happen
- A link to the website of the conference (will be opened in the default browser)
- A link to the location of the conference (will open Apple Maps)
- A link to the CfP page (if available) and the date where the CfP will close
